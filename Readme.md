2. Next, access phpMyAdmin and create a new database using the provided `db.sql` file.
3. Then, navigate to `db.php` and update the following variables with your own database information:
    - `$servername = "localhost";`  <!-- Add your server name here -->
    - `$username = "root";`  <!-- Add your username here -->
    - `$password = "";`  <!-- Add your password here -->
    - `$database = "";`  <!-- Add your database name here -->
